## About dataset.
Due to the large size of the datasets, we have stored them in Google Drive: [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P42XsDWeMqAW33oS0gGamXEqxYiMjO5i?usp=drive_link)

if you want to use the original dataset(MegaVul), you can download it from the following link:https://github.com/Icyrockton/MegaVul

## Reproducing the experiments:
1.Use the py file under "data crawling and processing" for data processing. Of course, you can directly use the dataset we have processed: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P42XsDWeMqAW33oS0gGamXEqxYiMjO5i?usp=drive_link)

2.Run prompt_code&desc.py. After running, you can retrain the model and obtain results.

3.You can find the implementation code for the RQ1-RQ4 section and the Discussion section experiments in the corresponding folders.

## About dataset.
You can obtain our saved model and reproduce our results through the link:[Model Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RdWlH40EgAkyJ4QNGWwH1ZiQe1qGgG06/view?usp=sharing).
